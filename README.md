# Mazarin

**Go-based proxy server with web authentication, firewall capabilities, and more to come :)**



## Who is Mazarin

Named after Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the influential 17th-century chief minister and regent of France, who acted as a powerful proxy to King Louis XIV during his minority. Just as Mazarin managed and secured the affairs of the kingdom behind the scenes, this proxy server governs and protects access to your network services - providing controlled, authenticated, and secure connections.



## Backstory

Originally, Mazarin was created out of necessity: a friend wanted to connect to my game server, but was behind a VPN, making IP-based whitelisting impossible. Without the budget for a proper VPS or commercial solutions, I built Mazarin as a self-hosted proxy with authentication and firewall features to whitelist users dynamically.

Since then, Mazarin has evolved into a more robust proxy server with plans for token-based authentication, domain routing, SSL support, and advanced firewall features like auto-blacklisting and rate limiting.
